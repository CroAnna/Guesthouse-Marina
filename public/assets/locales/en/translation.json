  "zamrsje_desc_2": "The main feature of Zamršje is the river Kupa, or as the Romans called it, the winding river - where today you can enjoy the beautiful landscape and nature. Swimming in the Kupa River is a particularly popular activity in the summer months, while walking, cycling and fishing are ideal activities in the autumn and spring months. Zamršje is an ideal place to escape from the hustle and bustle of the city and relax in nature by the river Kupa.",

During the summer months, residents bathe in the Kupa River, at the swimming pool that they take care of and arrange themselves. In addition, the coast is perfect for fishing river fish such as carp and pike, and this relaxing sport is ideal for anyone who wants to relax while spending time in nature.",
  "zamrsje_desc_5": "In addition to people, the place is ideal for animals, for example dogs who like to swim because the river is not fast, and pets love to move through the shallows and catch dragonflies flying around the water lilies. It is a kilometer from the apartment to the swimming pool, and access is possible by bike and car. We recommend spending time on the coast and enjoying the peace (a picnic is a great idea).",
